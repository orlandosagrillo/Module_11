## What is created?

A Google Colab Notebook containing the data preparation, analysis, and visualisations for all the time series data that the MercadoLibre (the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America) needs to understand. Text and comments to document the findings, and answering of the question prompts is provided.


## Provided: 

- Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.
- An evaluation of how the company stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.
- A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.
- Answers to the questions in the Google Colab Notebook.
- (Optional) A plot of a forecast for the companyâ€™s future revenue.


## Steps:

1 - Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
2 - Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
3 - Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
4 - Create a Time Series Model by Using Prophet
5 (Optional) - Forecast the Revenue by Using Time Series Models
