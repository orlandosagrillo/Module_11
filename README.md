## What is created?

A Google Colab Notebook containing the data preparation, analysis, and visualisations for all the time series data that the MercadoLibre (the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America) needs to understand. Text and comments to document the findings, and answering of the question prompts is provided.


## Provided: 

- Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.
- An evaluation of how the company stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.
- A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.
- Answers to the questions in the Google Colab Notebook.
- (Optional) A plot of a forecast for the companyâ€™s future revenue.


## Steps:

- 1 - Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
- 2 - Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
- 3 - Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
- 4 - Create a Time Series Model by Using Prophet
- 5 (Optional) - Forecast the Revenue by Using Time Series Models


## Findings:

### 1 - Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic

Through the creation of two seperate dataframes, one presenting the search traffic trends for 2016 to 2020, whilst the other detailing the search traffic for the month of May in 2020. Patterns in both dataframes were found through the visualisation of plots, providing evidence that the median values correlated heavily, with very little variation in the data. Therefore, dispelling the possibility that large outliers or unusual patterns exist within the Hourly Google Search Traffic Dataframe.

### 2 - Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality



### 3 - Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns



### 4 - Create a Time Series Model by Using Prophet



### 5 (Optional) - Forecast the Revenue by Using Time Series Models
